Izzy Manual Testing Script:

Note that many of these steps require an alt account (so that your main account can put it back into a normal state afterward) and suitable .conf files (so there's enough data to test with).
Because this is a *manual* testing script, the goal is not be comprehensive coverage (or else we'd never get in the habit of always doing all of it). Instead, the goal is to cover a small subset of functionality that can be run through in at most a few minutes, and is either particularly critical or particularly likely to have issues undetectable by automated tests.

`.echo ack`

`.help`

`.config`
`.config ModRole`
`.config ModChannel`
`.config MentionResponses list`
`.config FilterIgnoredChannels list`
`.config FilterBypassRoles list`
`.config Aliases list`
`.config FilteredWords list`
at least one of these should have enough items to paginate

run `.config` with your alt, which should do nothing

make your alt leave the server
then reinvite it (or use an existing invite), which should post two modlogs

`.remindme 1 minute this is part of the test`, which should DM you in a minute

`.schedule list`, which should show a role removal task and an echo task

`.assignrole <@&1039194817231601695> <your alt> 10 seconds`, which should remove new-member-role much sooner

trip the filter with your alt (without a FilterBypassRoles role), which should silence the user, delete the message, post a message telling them off, post a modlog with embed and ping mods

manually give your alt back the member role

`.config FilterBypassRoles add <@&965978050229571634>`

now trip the filter again (with a FilterBypassRoles role), which should post a modlog with no pings or silencings

`.config FilterBypassRoles remove <@&965978050229571634>`

make your alt post the hardcoded spam test string to deterministically cause spam:
`=+i7B3s+#(-{Ã—jn6Ga3F~lA:IZZY_PRESSURE_TEST:H4fgd3!#!`
which should delete the message, silence your alt, post a mod log and a bulk deletion log

`.q`

`.lq`
`.lq <user/category>` with no quotes
`.lq <user/category>` with few quotes
`.lq <user/category>` with enough quotes to paginate

`.ban <your alt> 10 seconds`, which should remove your alt from the server, post messages and mod logs, then later allow the alt to rejoin

(we don't have a great way to repeatedly test raids right now; even the `.test raid` command requires seveal real user ids which would then get silenced and that's a mess to clean up)
